### This is a conglomerate Project to cover the topics in R4DS!

The idea is to create a "live" environment to cover certain topics in R Studio to assist me to get up to speed with the necessary tools for adequate data analysis.

- In the case where a topic or code is not understood, we can refer to the area where it is suppose to be covered in the RMD file.
- We can use preloaded datasets in R to practice certain weak areas
- We can raise certain issues which are not necessarily "work" related but worth researching or learning the "skill"
- We can monitor progress and identify strengths and weaknesses

# Programming in R Studio - Pipes
## The point of the **Pipe** is to help us read our code in an easy to understand way!!
### magrittr package - but all packages in tidyverse automatiically make 

When are we better off not using the *Pipe* ?

 (@) When **Pipes** are longer than ten steps (Rather create intermediate objects with meaningful names)
 (@) We have multiple *inputs* or *outputs* (the same solution as above applies)
 (@) When we are starting to think about a *directed graph* with a complex dependency structure
 
Remember that the``%T>%``can assist us with more complex *Pipes* 
-Effectively, the **T-Pipe** returns the left-hand side instead of the right-hand side incase we want to plot or print

# Introducing Functions 
## Allows us to automate common tasks in a more powerful and general way than copy-and-pasting
![We do not copy and paste](https://imaginationoverflowsw.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/anti-copy-paste.jpg)

What are the advantages of using *functions* ?

(@) You can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.
(@) As requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.
(@) You eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another)

##### We should seriously consider writing a `function` whenever we have copied and pasted a block of code more than **TWICE**

There are 3 steps to creating a new *function* ?

(@) You need to pick a name for the function
(@) You list the inputs, or arguments, to the function inside ```function```
(@) You place the code you have developed in **body** of the function

```rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}```

Most important attribute of functions: ** WE DO NOT WANT TO REPEAT OURSELVES**

## Conditional Execuion
An ```if``` statement allows us to conditionally execute code
```{r
if (condition) {
# code executed when the condition is **TRUE**
}
else {
# code executed when the condition is **FALSE**
}

```
